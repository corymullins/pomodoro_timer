# Pomodoro Timer App
This is a simple pomodoro timer desktop app built with Python and Tkinter.

## What is Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each 25 minute work period is called a pomodoro, after the Italian word for tomato. After 4 pomodoros, you take a longer 15-20 minute break. This workflow helps maximize focus and productivity.
